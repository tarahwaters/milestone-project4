# ðŸŒŸ nyreewaters art ðŸŒŸ
# - a full stack web e-commerce web application

------

This e-commerce website was built for professional artist and designer, Nyree Waters, as my final Milestone Project for the Code Institute Fullstack Webdevelopment diploma (2024).

My sister, Nyree, produces original and printed mix-media artworks that she often sells online, so for this project I decided to build her a new e-commerce platform for her art shop.

Through this website, Nyree hopes to share her passion for creating and design, and to offer products that have been lovingly created in her distinct abstract style.
She is also a talented musician, writer and works in art facilitation, so the website has future scope to help streamline all of her freelance services.

## Scope
### Trade Offs

Considering the user requirements and expectations, the table below shows the features that should be implemented to make an appealing and functional interactive game for users. Due to time constraints and my current skill level, some of these features are not implemented at this stage.

[X] indicates opportunities that were considered at the planning stage but were deemed not viable/feasible for this project sprint.
Y / N indicates a Yes / No as to whether each opportunity was acheived and implemented at this stage.

### Future Features

The following features would be considered in future work to the project that would improve the useability and interest of this app:

---

## Skeleton

Wireframes for the website were created using the UI wireframe tool, [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), to plan the layout.

The layout and design were kept consistent across the pages / devices as much as possible.
The overall design evolved as the project was developed, so some of the wireframe designs were not carried out / were adapted.

The app consists of the following pages:

For Admin Users only:

### Wireframes

![nyreewaters logo](/documentation/readme/nyreewaters-logo.jpg "nyreewaters name as logo")


### Color Scheme

[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a color palette for the design after consulting with Nyree.

![nyreewaters art colorscheme](/documentation/readme/nyreewaters-colorscheme.png "nyreewaters art colorscheme")

color contrast check - [coloors color contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/332e14-e5ffc8)

### Typography

With reference to Nyree's [main website](https://nyreewaters.com) and her font styling preferences, we searched for font pairings that matched.

[Typ.io](https://typ.io/s/4c28) provided us with the following font pairing inspiration which is used on [mikekus.com](https://mikekus.com):

![Typ.io font-pairing example image](/documentation/readme/font-pairing-example.jpg "font-pairing example from Typ.io")

- **Courier New** (body)
- **Helvetica** (headings)
- **Monaco**
- **Helvetica Neue**

## Information Architecture
## Database Structure
### Details
- I have used a **Postgres** relational database via [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) throughout the entire project development.
- The project is directly connected to the deployed database on Heroku during development  - this was necessary to work with the Code Institute Dockerfile that was used.

### Diagram
- The diagram (created on [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/)) shows a layout of the tables created by my models in the database.
- The diagram below omits the tables created by default, except the user table, as well as the tables created by [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

![Database Schema Diagram](/documentation/readme/drawSQL-schema.png "database schema diagram")


**Please Note:** 
- Default tables created by [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as well as [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) have been ommited from this section. Please refer to their documentation (refrenced [here](#tools-and-technologies-used)) for more information on their data models.
- The CountryField is from [django-countries](https://github.com/SmileyChris/django-countries).
