# ðŸŒŸ nyreewaters art ðŸŒŸ
# - a full stack e-commerce web application

------

This e-commerce website was built for professional artist and designer, Nyree Waters, as my final Milestone Project for the Code Institute Fullstack Webdevelopment diploma (2024).

My sister, Nyree, produces original and printed mix-media artworks that she often sells online, so for this project I decided to build her a new e-commerce platform for her art shop.

Through this website, Nyree hopes to share her passion for creating and design, and to offer products that have been lovingly created in her distinct abstract style.
She is also a talented musician, writer and works in art facilitation, so the website has future scope to help streamline all of her freelance services.

### Future Features

The following features would be considered in future work to the project that would improve the useability and interest of this app:

---

## Skeleton

Wireframes for the website were created using the UI wireframe tool, [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), to plan the layout.

The layout and design were kept consistent across the pages / devices as much as possible.
The overall design evolved as the project was developed, so some of the wireframe designs were not carried out / were adapted.

The app consists of the following pages:

For Admin Users only:

### Wireframes

Below are the initial wireframes created for the project during the planning stage. As the project developed, the layouts were adapted to accomodate for the content included / limitations in design scope.

- [Homepage](/documentation/wireframes-homepage.png) âœ…
- [About](/documentation/wireframes-about.png) âœ…
- [Shop Category](/documentation/wireframes-category.png) âœ…
- [Shopping Bag](/documentation/wireframes-shopping-bag.png) âœ…
- [Checkout](/documentation/wireframes-checkout.png) âœ…
- [Checkout Success](/documentation/wireframes-checkout-success.png) âœ…
- [Individual Product](/documentation/wireframes-product.png) âœ…

The following pages were not designed using wireframes due to time restraints, and instead followed a similar layout structure to the main pages (above) that were created first:
- My Profile
- Login
- Register
- Contact
- Leave a Review **
- Search results
- Bespoke
- FAQs

****Note** - Review feature was not included at this stage of production (see [Scope](#scope) for more details)

---

## Surface

### Logo

The following logo was used from Nyree's original website:

![nyreewaters logo](/documentation/nyreewaters-logo.jpg "nyreewaters name as logo")


### Color Scheme

[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a color palette for the design after consulting with Nyree.

![nyreewaters art colorscheme](/documentation/nyreewaters-final-colorscheme.png "nyreewaters art colorscheme")

[Coloors color contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/332e14-e5ffc8) was also used to check font colors contrasted well against coloured backgrounds for improved accessibility.

#E5543C
#35CCCF
#000000
#343A40
#EADECE
#F8F9FA

### Typography

With reference to Nyree's [main website](https://nyreewaters.com) and her font styling preferences, we searched for font pairings that matched.

[Typ.io](https://typ.io/s/4c28) provided us with the following font pairing inspiration which is used on [mikekus.com](https://mikekus.com):

![Typ.io font-pairing example image](/documentation/font-pairing-example.jpg "font-pairing example from Typ.io")

Font Pairing Inspiration:
- **Courier New** (body)
- **Helvetica** (headings)
- **Monaco**
- **Helvetica Neue**

Since not all these fonts were available for free or were not accessible using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), the following font styles were used as close alternatives:

Font Styles used in project:

- **Courier New** (body)
- **Courier Prime** (backup body)
- **Inter** (headings, nav links, or for style emphasis)
- **San-serif** (backup font)

## Information Architecture
## Database Structure
### Details
- I have used a **Postgres** relational database via [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) throughout the entire project development.
- The project is directly connected to the deployed database on Heroku during development  - this was necessary to work with the Code Institute Dockerfile that was used.

### Diagram
- The diagram (created on [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/)) shows a layout of the tables created by my models in the database.
- The diagram below omits the tables created by default, except the user table, as well as the tables created by [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

![Database Schema Diagram](/documentation/drawSQL-schema.png "database schema diagram")

## Database Models

**Please Note:** 
- Default tables created by [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as well as [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) have been ommited from this section. Please refer to their documentation (refrenced [here](#tools-and-technologies-used)) for more information on their data models.
- The CountryField is from [django-countries](https://github.com/SmileyChris/django-countries).
